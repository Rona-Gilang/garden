      <h1>Agroforestry - Forest Innovation for Modern Era</h1>
      <p>
        In todays modern era, human civilization has taken almost all available land they can get. 
        Pushing Mother Nature to the corner, leaving only small pieces of land here and there. 
        Yet, that was't enough. They still want more and more, trying to satisfy their bottomless desires. 
        Oh dear Mother Nature, when will you wake up and teach your bratty kids their lesson?
      </p>

      <p>
        There are three key points to mention in regards of the state of our forest today.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Deforestation = decrease</dt>
        <dd>We have reached the point where all easy-land-takeover has been emptied, 
          leaving only small-piece-forests that are hard to get.</dd>
        <dt>Climate-related stressor = constant</dt>
        <dd>The day we learn how to use coal, oil, and gas to our benefit, 
          the day we change the earth forever, for better or worse.</dd>
        <dt>Forest product demand = increase</dt>
        <dd>As more and more human alive, so do more and more things they needed to live.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        As neglegted as we are, they are still some poeple who care deeply about Mother Nature.
        They believe forest is not just here to be exploited, it serve crucial role in our wellbeing. 
        Like lungs giving us oxygen to breathe, liver breaking down toxins to safe, 
        kidneys filtering the pure from the waste, and heart distributing nutrient to sustain. 
        Forests are organ of the earth, and destroying it... you know what will happen. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Believe alone is not enough, we need action. But how do we take action, and what action do we take?
        Answer: innovatation. Thus here are what and how to innovate. 
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="" alt="Visual diagram showing several points addressing forest innovation">
      </figure>
      <p>
        The first group is to address the what&mdash;the purpose we aim to solve with the innovation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Conservation</strong>, to protect those who survived.</li>
        <li><strong>Restoration</strong>, to revive those who perished.</li>
        <li><strong>Sutainable use</strong>, to manage the challenge of existance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The second group is to address the how&mdash;the method we use to execute the innovation:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Social</strong>, ...</li>
        <li><strong>Financial</strong>, ...</li>
        <li><strong>Technological</strong>, ...</li>
        <li><strong>Institutional</strong>, ...</li>
        <li><strong>Policy</strong>, ...</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All above idea could be summarized in a single term: Agroforestry. 
        Agro means agriculture and forestry means&mdash;well, forestry. 
        So it is basically the practice of both agriculture and forestry in a single place. 
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="" alt="Visual illustration of agroforestry with its elements">
      </figure>
      <p>
        Agriculture practice have two elements that is crops and livestocks, 
        meanwhile agroforestry have it as trees.
        Some practice only combine two elements such as trees with crops, or trees with livestocks.
        But other use all the three elements that is trees, crops, and livestocks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In comparison with conventional agriculture practice,
        agroforestry can hold 50-80% more biodiversity with the same land space. 
        Furthermore, the diverse biodiversity makes agroforestry to have more resistance against
        environmental shocks and climate change problem. A truly magnificent solution!   
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="" alt="Visual illustration of agroforestry vs conventional agriculture">
      </figure>
      <p>
        Thankfully there have been many people who did this practice and have shared their knowledge.
        The book has writen some of them, about 18 case stuides. It's all good and inspiring ideas.
        Sadly with my current limited brainpower, I could only understand one idea from all of it.
        But hey, at least I could learn a thing. And that is the whole idea I write this article. 
        To introduce a single idea that is called Agroforestry, and how we can actually execute it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As I said before, agroforestry contains three elements: trees, crops, and livestocks.
        So indeed, executing this practice will be harder because we need multiple knowledge in different field.
        To address this problem then we need a medium which normal people who have no expertise in the field
        yet interested, could still practice and benefit from it. And in most time, this is the case. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But hey, this is the modern era. If you need to share knowledge, just make an app.
        And that's basically the whole idea is. To create an app to help farmer learn and practice agroforestry. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully there has been people who created this kind of app. 
        Although I don't think the app is globally available. 
        Afterall, what we grow and what we eat are a bit different. Each place has its own local variant. 
        But still, we can use the same concept. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The app is mainly created for farmers as praticer and goverment workers as helpers to help the farmers do the practice. 
        The main mechanism would be to input some of the key parameters about what resources and
        what kind of practice the wants. Then the app will do the analysis to give the result as recommendation
        on how to do the practice, why and what are the best options, and where to get more resources that are needed.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="" alt="Visual illustration of an agroforestry app">
      </figure>
      <p>
        The input parameters would include such as: ...
        The output recommendation would result such as: ...
      </p>
      <p>
        And this article sharing idea of mine will end this short. 
        So far, I only share the basic concept of the idea I got from reading the said book. 
        But, this is only the idea, still far from the real practice. 
        So I will continue to read and do research in continuation to develop this idea to real. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By the time I write this, I have only read a single book.
        Not yet dig deeper on what's the real thing happening outside in real world.
        So the next step has been clear: to read and research the availability of this app&mdash;
        whether it has been available or not in my country and how does it do, 
        also to gain more resources as if to create it our own that can be used to improve whether to improve
        the available app or to lunch the new if not yet available. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the book I mention&mdash;well, it's right below this.
        I write a simple review as part of this article.
        And if you are interested, 
        I have included a link as this is a free ebook you can download from an international organization.
